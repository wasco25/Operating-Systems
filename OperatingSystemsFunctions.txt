Operating System Functions

There are many parts that complete the operating system.  Operating systems act a a bridge of communication between the user and all of the computer hardware.  Some of the 
important functions of the operatin system are security, device management and memory management.  There are other functions of the operating system but I will focus on these 
functions. 

Security

Operating System controls the security of the device.  Security is important becuase it provides protection of resources like the memory disk, software and the CPU.  Security 
can be made up of several subcategories such as authentication, passwords, program threats and system threats.  There are others but I will discuss these parts.  Authentication
identifies the user and which program they are authorized to use.  This can be done by username/password, key cards and fingerprint/retina patterns.  

Memory Management 

Memory management is like security in the aspect that it can be broken down into several subcatergories.  Memory management is the process of coordinating the computer memory.
Memory management also does all the coordinating of the computer memory.  Memory management has a subcategory of segmented memory management, single contiguous allocation, paged
memory management and memory allocation.  There are other things that go into memory management as well.
